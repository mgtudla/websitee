          <P>
        
            Before choosing the desired track or strands, make sure to research. 
            Identify possible careers and job opportunities in the future and look into average salary offers. It should help you start visualizing what you want to do, and therefore choosing the right track to jumpstart your career.
            <br>
            <br>
            Next, consider yourself. Assess strengths, weaknesses, interests, and skills that will help lead you to a fruitful academic journey and, 
            eventually, a successful career. In addition, get advice from school guidance counselors, seniors, or loved ones. 
            People who have been down that path before may help you weigh the pros and cons of a certain track or strand.</P>
