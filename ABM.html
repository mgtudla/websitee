               <br>
               <br>
               <b> ABM Strand:</b> 
               ABM is one of the four strands in the Academic track of the K-12 curriculum. It’s a course that focuses on teaching students business management concepts such as accounting, 
               finance, operations, entrepreneurship, business mathematics, and marketing.

              <br>
              <br>
              In this strand, you’ll deep dive into subjects such as applied economics, business ethics, 
              fundamentals of ABM, business math and finance, organization and management, principles of marketing,
               and business enterprise simulation. These core subjects will help you hone your business acumen, acquire many other skills,
               and prepare you to be competitive industry experts in the future.
               <br>
               <br>
              
               The ABM strand is a strong stepping stone if you want to pursue business, accountancy, 
               other relevant courses in college. Furthermore, it’s an integral preparatory program for those who want to engage in entrepreneurship or other business-related careers.
               <br>
               <br>
               ABM is a good starting point if you want to have your own business. 
               However, it goes beyond that. ABM opens a lot of career opportunities and shouldn’t be boxed in business management and accountancy.
               <br> 
               Aside from wide ranging career paths, this course brings out critical skills—communication, 
               decision making, attention to detail, and innovation—needed to thrive in the professional world. Hence, it won’t be a waste of time even if you want to take a different path after senior high school. ABM teaches you to be globally competitive and be ever ready for a dynamic work environment 
               and various industries.
