             HUMSS, which stands for Humanities and Social Sciences, is one of the four major strands that Reedley International School offers to our senior high school students. 
             <br> <br>This strand tackles a wide range of disciplines, with a special focus on the investigation and inquiry into human situations. Like other stands, it provides learners with a deeper understanding of specific fields. In HUMSS’s case, it is designed to effectively prepare students who want to pursue a degree in liberal education. 
             In this post, we detail the HUMSS curriculum at length, and why an incoming senior high school student may opt for this strand.
